I’m a PhD candidate in Applied & Computational Mathematics at Caltech. I’ve been working with Franca Hoffmann since 2023 May on mean-field theory, interacting particle systems, and collective dynamics. Earlier, till the end of 2022, I was advised by Oscar Bruno on high-performance numerical methods for PDE, which shaped my appreciation for both analytical structure and computational performance.

Research
======
My current research lies at the intersection of **interacting particle systems**, **mean-field limits**, and stochastic optimization and sampling algorithms such as Consensus-Based Optimization/Sampling (CBO/S). I’m particularly interested in understanding how **macroscopic** behaviors emerge **from microscopic dynamics**, and how tools from **kinetic theory**, **probability**, and **partial differential equations** can be used to rigorously analyze and design efficient algorithms. 

About me
======
Prior to joining Caltech, I earned a **BBA in Business Management** and a **BS in Mathematics** from Yonsei University. I began in business,  but after taking my first math class in junior year, I found myself wanting to learn more. I ended up adding a second major and took advanced courses in real analysis, PDEs, topology, abstract algebra, and more—mainly out of curiosity, without planning to pursue math in graduate school at the time.
