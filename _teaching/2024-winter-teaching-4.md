Reviews from Students - Review 5/5 from Grads & 4.4/5 from Undergrads
======
* (Grad) She was very supportive, always open to questions, well prepared for any question, and kind to explain concepts. She was the best to clarify doubts!

* (Undergrad) Tough grader and most of her comments on the grading made no sense/overcomplicated the subject. Also very nitpicky with grading even if the answer is right but you are missing some small steps.
