Course Description
======
Measure transport is a rich mathematical topic at the intersection of analysis, probability
and optimization. The core idea behind this theory is to rearrange the mass of a reference measure to match a target
measure. In particular, optimal transport seeks a rearrangement that transports mass with minimal cost. The theory of
optimal transport dates back to Monge in 1781, with significant advancements by Kantorovich in 1942 and later in the
90’s, e.g. by Brenier. In recent years, measure transport has become an indispensable tool for representing probability
distributions and for defining measures of similarity between distributions. These methods enjoy applications in image
retrieval, signal and image representation, inverse problems, cancer detection, texture and color modelling, shape and
image registration, and machine learning, to name a few. This class will introduce the foundations of measure transport,
present its connections and applications in various fields, and lastly explore modern computational methods for finding
discrete and continuous transport maps, e.g. Sinkhorn’s algorithm and normalizing flows.
The purpose of this course is to give an introduction to transportation of measures, focusing on essential parts of the
theory as well as some exciting applications and recent research developments, in the hope that it may find use in the
research of the participants.
